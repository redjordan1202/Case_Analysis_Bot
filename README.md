# Case_Analysis_Bot

This is a simple program that pulls cases from Salesforce within a certain date range. Then it pulls info on the cases and writes that info to a spreadsheet for future review.

**Built With**

- [Simple-Salesforce](https://github.com/simple-salesforce/simple-salesforce) To access Salesforce
- [Gspread](https://github.com/burnash/gspread) To read and write data to Google Sheets

**Usage**

This script was made to help with case reviews. It has 2 built-in date ranges for the 2 kinds of common case reviews I do, Bi-Weekly Check in and Historical Reviews. Also has an option for custom time range in case I need to review cases in a different time range.
